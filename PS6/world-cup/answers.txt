Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:
By increasing the number of N in the simulation, the Belgian team is always at the top of the winners,
this result is evident from N = 100,000  onwards.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:
N = 10,000 is appropriate because the results have been stable since then.
